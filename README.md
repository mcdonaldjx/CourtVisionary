# CourtVisionary
A Java program that uses an API to pull and display basketball stats of players, teams, and games.


NOTE: You will need an API Key from https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba in order to use this program to its full capacity. A Demo version of the program has also been included, but does not pull live stats.
